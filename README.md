# ✈️💥 The Worst Flight of Your Life

**No brakes. No landing gear. Just walls.**

## ☁️ About The Project
Welcome to a flight simulator where you have zero control over your speed. The plane moves forward automatically; your only job is to not crash.

You are piloting a tiny biplane through a canyon of massive, unforgiving monoliths. The gaps are tight, the speed is constant, and the only way out is through.

**The Mechanics:**
* **Constant Velocity:** You cannot slow down to aim. You have to react instantly.
* **Vertical Precision:** The gameplay is purely about altitude control. Thread the needle or hit the concrete.

## 🕹️ Controls
Simplicity is the ultimate deception.

| Action | Input |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pitch Up** | `W` or `Up Arrow` |
| **Pitch Down** | `S` or `Down Arrow` |

*That's it. You can't turn. You can't stop.*
